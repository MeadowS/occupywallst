I know people who work there and they would be thrilled to make 10 dollars an hour.  Granted wages differ based on location and the cost of living in the area the business is located.  So businesses located in a higher cost area inherently pay more (common sense).  In all actuality the \"10 dollars\" an hour made in higher living areas really equates to minimum wage or slightly over.  \n\nEven at just below 20k a year a person still cannot afford their basic necessities.  These basic necessities have changed over time but they include houseing, food, utilities, medical/dental/vision, car and auto insurance.  At bare minimum these things cost 1700 dollars a month.  That comes out to 400 dollars over 20k.  So I am extremely confused why you are supporting my arguments for me? I appreciate it!\n\nThe assumption I am making is that any person, in any job, should make enough money to take care of them selves.  I never said that a store clerk should make high wages, but no person should ever have to slave 40 hours a week, every week, get paid nothing, have no benefits and still have to struggle to pay their bills and provide for them selves.  That is greedy business people thinking they are better than the average person because they came up with a great idea.  They are no better than anyone else.  People who started with nothing and build a million or billion dollar empire should do well to remember where they came from.  The problem is that a lot of people with money are born into it and have no idea what it is to budget, go without, go hungry so your kids can eat.  The practice of using and abusing the average work is inhumane and crule.  In fact I would even go so far to say that the practices are unconstitutional.  We as American citizens are guaranteed the right to life, liberty and the persuit of happiness.  What businesses are doing are denying people the right to live (and not in the literal sense so come back with something stupid).   \n\nAs for your oh so poetic comments on the salary of a CEO.  I never said the money taken away from CEOs or stock holders had to only translate into an hourly increase. It could be used toward improving aspect of the company that involve everyone, for example, better insurance, offering sick time and vaction pay, holiday bonuses etc.  If we are talking about putting back money into the company, then there are plenty of share holders, besides the CEO, who make a great deal of money.  They can take pay cuts also.  Which will certainly privide more money.  Lets not forget all the tax breaks businesses get from the government.  There is more than enough money for businesses to pay more, provide better benefits, and create more jobs.  So please stop making it sound like Walmart and other companies are so victimized and are doing us such a great service because they simply provide work.

Every boycott or attack on businesses prevents people (99%) from earning income. Is it right because you have made bad decisions to punish EVERYONE who has a job? \n\nWhat happens if you actually succeed in financially impacting or causing the collapse of a corporation?..... More layoffs, increased unemployment, additional need for government run social assistance, more people who can not pay their bills? So just how will these actions against the 99% help the 99%? When the doors close, the people who will feel the pain are the employees.... \n\nThe so called 1% have savings and investments and typically don't live paycheck to paycheck, unlike most of your so called 99%. The 1% you are trying to hurt will still have food on the table and keep paying their bills, and will most likely start another endeavor to make money because they are entrepreneurs who make things happen for themselves vs waiting for handouts, blaming others, or waiting till it's too late and wondering what happened and crying why me. \n\nLife is about choices, change, accountability, god, family, country, and values. If your foundation is weak (values, beliefs) your house will not be strong (life's decisions) and things will crumble around around you. When things crumble, what are you doing to rebuild, and fortify your house? Do you stand and watch it fall blaming others, or do you get your hands dirty and repair it. When do people have to look around and take responsibility for their individual choices? \n\nAre we becoming a country where we believe it is the governments role or responsibility to manage our lives? Today you are fighting against the failed policies and bad decisions of the government by asking the government to put in more social and entitlement policies to manage and control your future rather than fixing the problems. Are you looking at the history and risks of what you are demonstrating for... more social programs and government control? The government has never been successful in business or managing anything!!!!!\n\nIf you knew that Wal-Mart doesn't treat its employees correctly or pay enough why did you take the job or shop there when they came into your town?

If you didn't study finance, history, economics, or didn't take the time read the contract, why is it someone else's fault? If you kept your head down in the sand and didn't participate in our political system to ensure someone who represented your interests was elected and you just complained, why are you so upset and surprised? \n\nAll of these problems didn't happen overnight, it took years. But it doesn't take a revolution to change things. If you are the 99% you can constructively work together to elect representatives who will champion your causes and make change. Work together to change the laws and systems. Be accountable, be part of the solution not the problem.\n\nWhy do I not see any ideas for the 99% banding together and helping each other to improve, achieve, or sustain? Only calls for assistance or shouts of blame. If people lose jobs, can't eat, lose their home, etc because of OWS actions, what are your plans to help and support them? Where are your solutions or forward looking plans....

This is not a conspiracy and all the facts are there for you to see and find. They are capitalizing on our weaknesses and willingness to follow, put the sheep out for slaughter to spark the flame! This tactic has been used successfully over and over throughout history and today. Insight the mob and they will fight back.\n\nHere are the real organizers of OWS: http://www.overexposed.com/tag/organizers/\n\nWhile many of the issues regarding banking regulation, taxes, government spending, sustaining and managing public programs, etc. are worthy causes and deserve public debate and require drastic change, there are forces behind the OWS movement who want more than change... If you think OWS is about peaceful change and is a grass roots coalition spreading across the world, you should just look around at the symbols and listen to each other.  Just look at the banner on the top of this web page: Revolution - an overthrow or repudiation and the thorough replacement of an established government or political system by the people governed. A radical (bottom of page) and pervasive change in society and the social structure, especially one made suddenly and often accompanied by violence. \n\nThe fist pump graphic/logo (top of page and signs all over) that has been a symbol at the OWS protests was a clear sign this has been in works for some time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpXbA6yZY-8 They say there is no agenda or leadership, that is so they can get the sheep to follow blindly and then a spark will ignite the fire of violence and revolution, leading to the total collapse of the US economy.... Their main goal. Why do you think the World Trade Center was a chosen target? Islamist, Communists, socialists, and radicals are all following the plan.... Unfortunately, too many Americans are caught up in belonging to something without knowing what the end game is. If they knew the real goals, they may not follow so eagerly.\n\nHere is what people should think about and question: Do you know the leaders and influencers behind OWS? There are people behind these protests who want nothing more than the collapse of our government and economy because they hate America and the American way. There have been people (radicals, socialists, Marxists, and several organizations) wanting and planning this for years. If OWS succeeds in their goal to collapse the economy, all the reasons you think you are protesting will become reality. There will truly be months, years, or decades of real economic depression, social chaos, food shortages, civil unrest, starvation, homelessness, job loss, etc. The banks will surely control the money by order of the government which will not go away. We will see Military on the streets, marshal law will be imposed, the rights you currently have will be suspended, and in fact we will have given the government more power. \n\nThis is not just rhetoric or me ranting.

You need to get an education on how corporations are FORCED (through your valued regulation) to make financial reports. a few important points for you all to understand:\n      FIRST, profit is not cash that's in the bank, it's a periodic statement of earnings based on sales and expenses recognized in that same period. Where this is important is because significant investments (like new stores and other long-term improvements) do not show up as an expense the minute you pay for them, they are spread-out over many many years, which means that typically only 1/7 to 1/30th of Walmart's investments are recognized on the income statement that reports it's \"profit\".\n    SECOND: Walmart had $400 B + of sales last year, so $15B of profit is actually very very little % of it's overall sales (3.9% to be exact). Think about it this way, Walmart is a corporation that is publicly held. It is owned by Billions of people who daily decide whether to invest their money in Walmart or a savings account. Some months, it probably looks better for them to move the company to the savings account. \n    THIRD: Just because Walmart is so big, their tiny profit seems so big, but it really isn't. It's naive of people to not educate themselves before getting up in arms over what is really tiny profit. \n     FOURTH: Let's look at your silly proposals to pay health insurance for all of Walmart's employees. The company employs 2.1 Million people (or approx 2.1 M more jobs than the occupy protesters are occupying themselves). The average cost of health insurance is about $5,000 per year (just for the individual, we're not even talking about their families). This expense would then reduce Walmart's profit by $10.5 B. This one gesture alone would leave the company with a profit of close to 1% of sales. What do you think would happen then? You got it, people would not want to buy or hold the company's stock, which would result in the company eventually dieing since it's ability to secure cash for improving stores will be eliminated. Oh yeah, then those 2.1 M people will be out of a job altogether. I'm beginning to wonder if the OWS people care if anyone has a job....\n  \n    Unfortunately for many of you OWS air heads, the minor complexities of the way our financial systems work is too great for you to mentally overcome.

I do not know what your economic situation is and I am not going to attempt a guess.  Your pass at justifying the corruption on  \"being human\" is weak.  The truth is the stock holders and CEO's running these companys are greedy! Lets take Walmart for example.  It is on the top of any list at being one of the most profitable businesses.  In fact billions of dollars in revenue and billions of dollars in profits.  Instead of these profits being used to give raises, better benefits, or to create jobs, they are being used to line the pockets of those running the business.  You might not be aware but one billion dollars reinvested back into the company every year would make things significantly better for ALL Walmart employees.  According to you that is completly unreasonable.  Heavans forbid that the CEO of Walmart make a million or two less!  As for your statement regarding changing jobs.  Jobs are not out there for those at the bottom part of the 99 percent.  Any jobs that are available only pay  minimum wage or slightly over.  A single person with no kids cannot sufficiently provide for them selves getting paid minimum wage.  There is no possible way for a person to pay for all of their necessisites (food, shelter, utilities, transportant) on 200 dollars a week.  People go to work, so they can pay their bills and in most cases not even make enough to do that.  So I guess my point is, who do you think you are?  How do you look at your self in the mirror?

He also doesn't have any money after bills to pay the bloated tuition that the college system wants to charge him. \n\nLoans?

If his pay gets cut then he will fall behind on bills, eventually leading to the same conclusion.
